# Gene-Expression of Charr in Ãžingvallavatn, Iceland

Clustering and prediction of the genome of 8 types of Charr. 4 of them are found in the nature and 4 are hybrids, made in the lab.


The first report is clustering, then we try and predict the clusters using random forest.

The data itself may not be published as for now.
